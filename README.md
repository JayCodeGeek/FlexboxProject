# FlexboxProject

To understand the concept of flexbox i have created this project.
In the process of developing this project i learned properties of flexbox and why it is used.
Properties such as flex-direction, flex-flow, flex-wrap, flex-basis, gap, justify-content, align-items, align-content etc..
Flexbox made it easier to set the layout with only few lines of code.
In this project i've added few popular pc games that are played most. 
I've also embedded youtube trailer for each game so that user i can watch each of them.
